1. Introduction
In the era of digital transformation, banking and financial institutions are creating a rigorous sync between robust technology and financial parameters. Credit/Loans are one of the key offerings by these institutions in this dynamic journey where the highly competitive business environment among these institutions can lead to more exposure of risks.
Credit Risk can be defined as when a contractual party fails to meet the obligations on the agreed terms. According to the conventional formula of Credit Risk:
Credit Risk = Exposure × Probability of default × (1 - Recovery Rate)
Where:
* Exposure = Possibility of Default
* Probability of Default = Default on its obligation
* Recovery rate = Rate at which the outstanding credit is recovered
Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are to:
1. Implement and compare AI/ML models for credit risk assessment
2. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. Establish relationships between borrower characteristics and default probability
4. Provide insights for financial institutions to enhance their credit risk assessment processes
Significance of the Study
Traditional statistical methods like logistic regression and discriminant analysis have limitations when dealing with complex financial data. Machine learning offers promising alternatives by utilizing advanced algorithms to analyze vast ranges of data and identify complex patterns that may not be resolved through conventional approaches.
2. Literature Review
Evolution of Credit Risk Models
Credit risk assessment has evolved significantly from traditional statistical models to modern AI-based approaches. Early studies by FitzPatrick (1932) and the famous Altman model (1968) laid the foundation for statistical credit risk assessment.
Recent Research Findings
Thiel (2019) studied credit risk prediction through analytical AI tools in the digital era, researching across the UK and Netherlands. The study concluded that AI models perform better than traditional models.
Matcov (2024) investigated interpretability methodologies such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to improve customer comprehension of AI-driven credit risk evaluation.
Wang et al. (2024) researched a multi-stage integrated model based on deep neural networks for credit risk assessment with unbalanced data, using K-Means SMOTE algorithm and ResNet feature extraction.
Berrada et al. (2022) reviewed how banks can benefit from Big Data analysis and AI, focusing on algorithms for data mining, supervised/unsupervised ML, and deep learning neural networks.
Key Findings from Literature
* Neural networks consistently outperform traditional statistical methods
* Ensemble methods and hybrid models show superior performance
* AI models can better handle non-linear and complex datasets
